#Ex 12 Prompting People using input function. Input will do all the prompting.
#We entered the prompt inside of the input function
print("How old are you?" , input())
height = input("How tall are you?")
weight = input("How much do you weigh?")

print(f"So, you're {age} years old, {height} tall and weigh {weight}.")
#This shortened the length of the program in ex 11
